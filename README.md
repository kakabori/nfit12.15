This version employs the cylindrical coordinates to calculate the structure 
factor, which means that the domains are treated as in-plane circles. 
This change of the coordinate system from the Cartesian to cylindrical appears 
to reduce the appearence of the so-called "spike" feature. While this is a nice
update in terms of the model, it is still far from perfect regarding fitting 
the data in the usual q range.

We still need to work hard on the theory to truly get this technique right.
